# 🏥 Hospital Management System (HMS)

A **Database-Driven Hospital Management System** built using **Python, MySQL, HTML, and CSS** to streamline hospital operations such as patient registration, appointment scheduling, billing, and record management.

This project is designed as an academic **DBMS + Python mini/major project**, following real-world healthcare workflows commonly seen in hospitals and clinics across India.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Managing hospital operations manually can be time-consuming and error-prone. This **Hospital Management System (HMS)** automates core hospital activities to improve efficiency, accuracy, and patient care.

The system enables hospital staff to:
- Register and manage patient records
- Maintain doctor details and availability
- Schedule and manage appointments
- Generate and manage billing information

By digitizing these processes, the HMS reduces administrative workload and supports faster decision-making—aligning with India’s growing focus on **digital healthcare solutions**.
